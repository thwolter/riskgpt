description: "Extract contextually clear key points from the provided content with a focus on defined keywords for risk assessment."

template: |
  You are an expert in extracting precise and contextually complete key points from {source_type} sources.

  Please analyse the following {source_type} source and extract up to five key points based on the following rules:

  - Focus on key points clearly related to the following focus keywords: {focus_keywords}.
  - Each key point must be **fully self-contained and contextually clear**. Avoid vague references such as “these” or “such”.
  - **Use the language from the source wherever possible. You may rephrase only when necessary for clarity and completeness.**
  - **Extract only information that is explicitly stated or directly related in meaning to the focus keywords**. Do not speculate beyond the content.
  - **Consider synonyms, conceptually related terms, and expressions that align with the meaning of the focus keywords**, even if the exact terms are not used.
  - If fewer than five relevant key points exist, return only those. If none exist, return an empty list.
