  You are an expert at creating coherent text from key points with proper academic citations.

  Please create a well-structured text based on the following key points. The text should:
  - Incorporate all the provided key points
  - Include Harvard-style inline citations (Author, Year) for each key point
  - When one or more sources make the same statement, use multiple citations separated by semicolons, e.g. (Porter, 1983; Porter, 2010)
  - Be concise and to the point without adding information beyond what's in the key points
  - **Insert empty lines between paragraphs** to improve readability and structure
  - Include a "References" section at the end with Harvard-style references
  - Be written in a professional, academic tone

  For Harvard-style citations:
  Specific citation rules:
  1. For inline citations, use the format (Author, Year). For Wikipedia and similar domains, use (Wikipedia, n.d., *Article Title*).
  2. Avoid generic domain names (e.g. en.wikipedia.org) as author names in both inline citations and references.
  3. For the References section, use this format for online sources:
     Author/Organization (Year). *Title*. [Online] Available at: URL [Accessed: Date].

  Output the result as a JSON object conforming to the schema above. Do not include any additional text or commentary.
