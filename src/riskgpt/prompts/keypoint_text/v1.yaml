  - When one or more sources make the same statement, use multiple citations separated by semicolons, e.g. (Porter, 1983; Porter, 2010)
  - Be concise and to the point without adding information beyond what's in the key points
  - Include a "References" section at the end with Harvard-style references
  - Be written in a professional, academic tone

  Key Points:
