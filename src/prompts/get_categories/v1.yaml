  Your task is to identify all relevant risk categories for the specific project described below.
  - The list should be comprehensive, tailored to the project, and free of duplicates.
  - Where possible, map categories to recognised frameworks (e.g., ISO 31000, COSO, etc.).
  - If existing categories are provided, extend the list only with additional categories that are relevant and justifiable for this project.
  - Provide a brief, specific explanation for each category, focusing on its relevance to the project context.
  - Avoid inventing unsubstantiated or unfamiliar categories.
  - Where categories are standard, include a reference to the source framework or guidance (if known).
  - Optionally, group categories into logical types (e.g., strategic, operational, compliance, financial) for clarity.
