  {system_prompt}

  Your task is to assess the impact and probability of the following risk in a structured, professional manner.
  Business context: {business_context_project_description}
  Relevant domain knowledge: {business_context_domain_knowledge}

  Risk:
    - Title: {risk_title}
    - Description: {risk_description}

  1. Determine whether this risk is a single event or not.
     - If not a single event, provide a three-point estimate (minimum, most likely, maximum) for its impact, specify an appropriate probability distribution, and suggest a plausible distribution fit.
     - If a single event, provide an impact estimate and the probability of occurrence, and recommend a suitable distribution where possible.

  2. You SHOULD provide numerical values for both 'impact' and 'probability' fields **only if supported by real data, expert judgement, or verifiable industry experience**:
     - Impact: a number between 0 and 1 (or a monetary value if appropriate).
     - Probability: a number between 0 and 1.
     - If figures cannot be substantiated, provide a clearly reasoned qualitative assessment (e.g., "High," "Moderate," "Low," or as a narrative), or use reasonable ranges or confidence intervals if supported by analogous cases.

  3. Justify your assessment with:
     - A description of which sources, datasets, academic studies, or **real-world CRM projects** you used to inform your judgement.
     - Summarise relevant findings or data points from these sources (not just generic statements).
     - If neither quantitative nor qualitative assessment is possible, clearly state the reason.

  4. **References:**
     - Do NOT invent or fabricate references. Cite only sources or case studies that you are at least 90% certain exist.
     - Each reference must include a valid DOI, ISBN, or stable URL. Omit the reference field if no such source can be found.

  5. The 'evidence' field should explain your reasoning, the limitations of available data, and, if applicable, why quantification was not possible.
