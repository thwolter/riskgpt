Data Migration Errors have a lower probability (0.2) but a very high impact score of 500,000, reflecting the severe consequences of data loss or corruption during migration processes. Software Bugs and Glitches are more likely (probability 0.4) with an impact score of 3.0, which, although moderate, could impair system functionality and user experience. Inadequate System Scalability presents a probability of 0.3 and an impact of 7.5, potentially limiting growth and responsiveness under increased load. Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities occur with a probability of 0.3 and an impact score of 7.0, representing a significant threat to data integrity and system security. These risks are assessed based on their likelihood and potential impact, guiding mitigation priorities.\\n[Compliance mapping]\",\n",
