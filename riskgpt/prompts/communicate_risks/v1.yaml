  • Do not duplicate content between the summary and the technical annex; the annex should expand on technical detail only where required for an analyst.

       - **Workshop:** Balanced detail, actionable insights, focus on collaborative next steps.
       - **Risk_internal:** Detailed, technical, referencing frameworks, controls, and methodologies.
       - **Audit:** Compliance-focused, referencing control environment, adherence to standards, and gaps.
       - **Regulator:** Formal, regulatory language, focus on compliance, statutory requirements, and risk exposure.
       - **Project_owner:** Practical, actionable summary of risks and mitigation relevant to project delivery.
       - **Investor:** Financial and reputational implications, materiality, risk/return considerations.
       - **Operations:** Operational impacts, continuity, process risks, and mitigation measures.
     - Summarise only information material and relevant for the selected audience, omitting unnecessary technical detail unless specifically required by the audience type.

     - Provide a comprehensive and structured analysis of each risk, including background, rationale, and supporting data or reasoning.
