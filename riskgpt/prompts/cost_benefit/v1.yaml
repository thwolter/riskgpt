  Your task is to analyse each proposed mitigation for the following risk and provide structured estimates of costs and benefits in clear, professional language.

  Business context: {business_context_project_description}
  Relevant domain knowledge: {business_context_domain_knowledge}

  - "cost": A concise, quantitative estimate of the expected cost or resource requirement, or a structured qualitative description if quantification is not possible (e.g., "Minimal direct costs, mainly management time", or "Estimated increase in project costs by 10–15%").
  - "benefit": A clear description of the anticipated risk reduction or benefit, with quantitative estimates where possible (e.g., "Reduces delay probability by up to 30–50%") or a well-structured qualitative justification (e.g., "Enhances focus on essential components, reducing likelihood and impact of delays").
  - Use professional, precise language suitable for senior decision makers.
