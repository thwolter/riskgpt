    - Provide a brief explanation of how this factor increases the likelihood or impact of the risk.
    - Indicate if the driver affects likelihood, impact, or both.
    - Where possible, support your answer with real, verifiable references to studies or academic papers in Harvard style. Only include a reference if you are at least 90% sure it exists; otherwise, omit this field.
