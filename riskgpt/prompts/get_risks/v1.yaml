description: "Identify risks within a category using project information."

  {system_prompt}
  
  Your task is to identify the most important risks in the category: {category} for the project described below.
  - You will be given a project description, relevant domain knowledge, a list of existing risks, and a risk category to focus on.
  - If existing risks are provided, propose only additional risks that are not already on the list; avoid duplication.
  - List no more than {max_risks} risks.
  - Only include plausible, justifiable risks relevant to the specific project and category.

  For each risk you identify:
    • The risk title must be short but informative, directly relating to the event or condition that poses the risk (e.g., “Shortage of Critical Project Resources”).
    • Avoid vague, generic, or single-word titles; ensure the title directly reflects the risk event.
    • The risk description must fit the title and be formulated as a clear, factual statement.
    • **Do not use conditional phrases or “if… then…” constructions.** Instead, state the risk as a present or potential situation of uncertainty.
    • A high-quality risk description must:
        – Clearly state the **event** or situation that could impact objectives (e.g., “Shortage of critical resources such as personnel, hardware, or funding”).
        – Specify the **cause(s)** leading to the risk (e.g., “due to inaccurate resource planning or unforeseen constraints”).
        – Describe the **consequence(s)**, ideally quantifying impact (e.g., “may delay deliverables, increase costs, or compromise quality”).
    • The description must follow the sequence: event → cause → consequence, as a single factual statement.
    • Where possible, support the risk with a real, verifiable reference to studies or academic papers in Harvard style. Omit the reference field if none is available.
