  {system_prompt}

  Your task is to suggest correlation tags for the risks associated with the specific project described below.
  - Tags are used to group risks that are likely to be correlated for risk modelling, aggregation, or scenario analysis purposes.
  - For each correlation tag, provide:
    - A short, descriptive tag name.
    - A brief justification explaining the shared exposure, driver, or event that links the grouped risks.
    - A list of risk IDs or titles from the provided risks input that are assigned to this tag (each tag must include at least two risks with a plausible correlation).
  - Correlation tags should be based on shared risk drivers, dependencies, or observed historical correlations.
  - Avoid unnecessary, spurious, or artificial groupings.
  - Do not invent industry terms or use unknown jargon.
  - Tags must be short, descriptive, and unambiguous.
